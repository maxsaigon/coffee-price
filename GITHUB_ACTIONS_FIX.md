```

## ✅ Solution: Updated to Latest Action Versions

The workflow file has been updated with the latest GitHub Actions:

### Before (Deprecated):
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4      # ❌ Old version
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3   # ❌ Deprecated
```

### After (Fixed):
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4          # ✅ Latest
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5      # ✅ Updated  
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4   # ✅ Current
```

## 📝 Changes Made

1. **Updated Python Setup**: `actions/setup-python@v4` → `actions/setup-python@v5`
2. **Updated Artifact Upload**: `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
3. **Maintained Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## 🚀 What to Do Next

1. **Commit and Push** these changes to your repository
2. **Re-run the workflow** - it should now work without deprecation warnings
3. **Monitor the Actions tab** for successful execution

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Workflows run without deprecation warnings
- ✅ Log files upload correctly on failure
- ✅ Health check reports generate properly
- ✅ All functionality maintained

## 🔍 Additional Notes

- GitHub periodically deprecates older action versions for security and performance
- It's good practice to update to latest versions when prompted
- The coffee price tracker functionality remains unchanged
- This is purely a maintenance update for GitHub Actions compatibility

## 🎯 Verification

After pushing the updated workflow:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Trigger a manual run to test
3. Verify no deprecation warnings appear
4. Check that logs/artifacts upload correctly

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Ready for production use!
