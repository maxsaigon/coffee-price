### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Robust Scraping Strategy
1. **Primary Method**: Standard requests with browser headers
2. **Fallback Option**: Cloudscraper for Cloudflare bypass
3. **Last Resort**: Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript rendering
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and notification

#### Anti-Bot Protection
- User agent rotation
- Request delays and retry mechanisms
- Session management
- Fallback to different scraping methods

#### Data Processing
- Real-time price extraction
- Currency conversion (USD → VND)
- Price change calculation
- Historical trend analysis

#### Notification System
- Rich message formatting in Vietnamese
- Price alerts with context
- Error notifications for system monitoring
- Success/failure tracking

### 🚀 Deployment Ready

#### GitHub Actions Configuration
- **Schedule**: Cron jobs for 8AM & 5PM Vietnam time
- **Secrets**: Secure storage for bot tokens
- **Monitoring**: Automatic health checks
- **Logs**: Detailed error reporting and artifacts

#### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Required packages in requirements.txt
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Telegram bot token and chat ID

### ⚠️ Known Limitations & Solutions

#### 1. Anti-Bot Protection
**Issue**: Investing.com may block automated requests
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Multiple fallback scraping methods
- Error notifications when all methods fail
- Graceful degradation with informative messages

#### 2. CSS Selector Changes
**Issue**: Website structure changes may break selectors
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Multiple selector strategies
- Fallback parsing methods
- Easy configuration updates in code

#### 3. Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Too frequent requests may trigger blocks
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Controlled request timing
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Session reuse and proper delays
